## Features

- **Dark Aesthetic**: A deep, almost black background complemented by glowing highlights to create an
  immersive coding experience.
- **Vivid Syntax Highlighting**: Neon and vibrant colors for your code, making keywords, functions, and
  constants pop with energy.
- **Balanced Contrast**: High-contrast accents and highlighters scream with neon vibrancy, but the colors stay
  balanced, so they don't overpower the interface.
- **Customizable**: This theme can be further tweaked to suit your preferences, whether it's adding more neon
  or calming down the intensity.

### Highlighted Colors:

- **Keywords**: Neon orange, electric greens, and vibrant purples.
- **Functions**: Bold, bright green to keep your functions clear and distinct.
- **Strings & Constants**: Bright, eye-catching pinks and yellows for easy differentiation.
- **Variables**: From electric mint greens to darker shades for local variables, keeping your code sharp and
  easy to read.

> ðŸ’¡ **Tip**: The theme looks best with font ligatures enabled and a programming font like Fira Code or
> JetBrains Mono.
